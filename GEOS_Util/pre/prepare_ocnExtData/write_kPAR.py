"""
Purpose:
 - Write out a k-PAR (Photosynthetically Available Radiation) file
 - _Current_ input is from what is used in the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) 
   [Weather Analysis and Prediction System](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/weather_prediction/) and 
   [MERRA-2 reanalysis](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/). This is a climatological field
   whose source was **not** documented, therefore unknown.
