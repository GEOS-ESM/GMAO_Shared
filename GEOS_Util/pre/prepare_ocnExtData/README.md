This directory contains scripts, fortran code to write out [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) formatted file(s) that could be
used as external dataset(s) in various applications of [GEOS-ESM](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM), for example:
- [GEOSgcm](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSgcm)
- [GEOSadas](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSadas)

It also has a few notebooks, see `notebooks/` that could be used to plot the data.

1. `write_kPAR.py`: A script to write out a climatological k-PAR (Photosynthetically Available Radiation) file.
   It will write a single file (with a single data record) for each month.
   Use for instance [xarray: ds.to_netcdf()](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_netcdf.html) to write a single file.

2. Fortran codes: `proc_SST_FRACI_eight.F90, proc_SST_FRACI_quart.F90` which rely on `sst_ice_helpers.F90`, compiled using `CMakeLists.txt` produce
   SST and sea ice concentration data on following regular lat-lon (date-line-edge, pole-edge) grids:
   - Executable: `sst_sic_eight.x` from `proc_SST_FRACI_eight.F90` on **1/8-deg**
   - Executable: `sst_sic_quart.x` from `proc_SST_FRACI_quart.F90` on **1/4-deg**
   - Usage instructions, if _your_ `install/bin` is: `INSTALL_BIN`,
     ${INSTALL_BIN}/sst_sic_EIGTHdeg.x bin_input; see example `bin_input`
   - f2py built `read_sst_ice_bin.f90` is useful to read back the binary files generated by above.

3. Use `plot_binary_sst_ice.py` to plot the **binary** SST and sea ice concentration; it relies on above `read_sst_ice_bin.f90`:
     ${INSTALL_BIN}/plot_binary_sst_ice.py -h
     ${INSTALL_BIN}/plot_binary_sst_ice.py -year 2020 -month 11 -day 28; 
     assuming `Ostia_sst_20201128.bin, Ostia_ice_20201128.bin` are in _current_ path.


**Note**:
 - For all python scripts, python3 or later version is needed.
