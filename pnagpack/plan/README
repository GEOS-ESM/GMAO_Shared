This directory contains files for two parallel Lanczos method.

(1) plandr, planso --

Straightforward extension of the original LANSO code.  Seeking
eigenvalues within a specified range.

(2) plandr2, planso2 --

Modified version of LANSO to computed a few extreme eigenvalues
of a given operator (OP, OPM).  This make the Lanczos iteration easier
to compare with other existing packages, e.g., ARPACK (PARPACK).

Both Lanczos methods use the same partial reorthogonalization scheme as
in the original LANSO.
