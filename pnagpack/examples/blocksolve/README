This directory contains an example of using PLANSO with BLOCKSOLVE95 to
compute eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator descretized on a 3-D
domain.  The matirx is generated using BLOCKSOLVE and the matrix-vector
multiplication is done with BLOCKSOLVE as well.  This example used
BLOCKSOLVE to distribute the matrix based on subcubes.  The example in
aztec directory is functionally the same but it distributed the matrix
as consecutive row blocks.
