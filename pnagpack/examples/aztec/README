This directory contains one example of using PLANSO and AZTEC together
to compute some eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator descretized on a
uniform 3-D grid.  The main program in azl.c generates the matrix and
setup AZTEC to perform matrix-vector multiplications.  The file azlan.c
contains the code to call PLANDR.  This program uses MAX_MEM (bytes)
amount of memory to store the Lanczos vectors and other workspace
required by PLANSO.

This examples calls Fortran programs from C.

Functionally, this example is the same as the one in blocksolve
directory.  The difference is that the matrix is distributed as
consecutive row blocks here and it is distributed based subcubes in
blocksolve example.
